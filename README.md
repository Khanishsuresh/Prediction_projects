# Prediction_projects

## **HUBBLEMIND**
### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating energy consumption in smart homes using a dataset that captures various influencing factors. The structured workflow consists of four key phases: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and documentation. 

### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Processed and refined the dataset to eliminate noise and irrelevant information, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted detailed analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, enhancing understanding of energy consumption dynamics.
- **Model Development**: Experimented with multiple predictive models and selected the most effective one based on performance metrics.
- **Documentation**: Provided comprehensive documentation detailing the methodologies, challenges faced, and insights gained throughout the project.

### Conclusion

This project successfully developed an accurate predictive model for energy consumption in smart homes.
- Prediction precentage(on train dataset) -> 88.96%
- Prediction precentage(on test dataset) -> 88.95%
